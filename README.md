A slop free experience for Brave Goggles
This a goggle for Brave search that contains everything I'm sick of seeing in the search results. This includes but is not limited to: SEO keyword stuffed useless websites, AI generated content, websites where everything is paywalled, websites that just exist to sell you shit, and a lot of other websites that just kind of suck. 
High quality and interesting results are boosted. Some topics that I hope to improve the results of include computer hardware, software, drugs, diseases, news, philosophy and religion, conlangs and linguistics, and Linux.
